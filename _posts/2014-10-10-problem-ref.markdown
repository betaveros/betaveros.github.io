  $$
  (xy+yz+zx)\left(\frac{1}{(x+y)^2} + \frac{1}{(y+z)^2} + \frac{1}{(z+x)^2}\right) \geq \frac{9}{4}
  $$
- [ISL 1988 #4](http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=41&t=57272): if $$1, 2, \ldots, n^2$$ are placed in a $$n \times n$$ chessboard, some two adjacent numbers differ by at least $$n$$
